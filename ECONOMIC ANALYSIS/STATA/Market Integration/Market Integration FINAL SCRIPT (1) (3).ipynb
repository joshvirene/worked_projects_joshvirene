    "1. Summarize the Time Variable: The `summ time` command summarizes the `time` variable. This provides the minimum and maximum values of `time`, which will be used in the loop.\n",
    "1. Initialize an ID Variable: The `local id = 0` command initializes a local macro variable `id` to 0. This will be used to keep track of the loop iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loop Over Time Values: The ```forvalues t = r(min)'/r(max)'``` loop iterates over each value of `time` from the minimum `(r(min))` to the maximum `(r(max))`. The `qui` (stands for `quietly`) prefix suppresses the output of the loop.\n",

    "1. Display Time Value and Increment ID: The `noi dis \"[t'] \" _c` command displays the current time value (t) and a carriage return (_c) without a newline. The `local ++id` command increments the id variable by 1. The  ```use `junk', clear``` command reloads the dataset from the temporary file `junk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep Data for Current Time Value: The `keep if time == t'` command keeps only the observations where time is equal to the current loop value (t). The `dyads FID, dy(Averageofprecmt_kg)` command creates dyads based on the `FID` variable and the variable `Averageofprecmt_kg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Append and Save Dyads: The if `id'!=1 append using work/dyads` command appends the current dyads to the existing `work/dyads` file if this is not the first iteration of the loop. The `save work/dyads, replace` command saves the updated `dyads` dataset to `work/dyads`, replacing any existing file with the same name."

It calculates the mean of the treatment variable for each unique combination of `FID` and `FID_d`. The resulting dataset will have one observation for each unique pair of `FID` and `FID_d`, with the treatment variable representing the average treatment value for that pair. \n",

    "- Purpose: Tests the null hypothesis that the panel series is stationary.\n",
    "- Details: This test is similar to the KPSS test for individual time series. A rejection of the null hypothesis indicates non-stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Harris-Tzavalis Test (`ht`):\n",
    "- Purpose: Tests the null hypothesis that the panel series has a unit root.\n",
    "- Details: This test is designed for panels with large time dimensions (T) and moderate cross-sectional dimensions (N).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Im-Pesaran-Shin Test (`ips`):\n",
    "- Purpose: Tests the null hypothesis that all panels contain a unit root.\n",
    "- Details: This test allows for individual unit root processes, making it more flexible. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one panel is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Breitung Test (`breitung`):\n",
    "- Purpose: Tests the null hypothesis that the panel series has a unit root.\n",
    "- Details: This test does not require bias correction and is considered more powerful for small T and large N panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (`dfuller`):\n",
    "- Purpose: Tests the null hypothesis that a time series contains a unit root.\n",
    "- Details: This is a widely used test for individual time series, including lagged differences of the dependent variable to account for serial correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Panel Unit Root Tests:\n",
    "- Hadri, Harris-Tzavalis, Im-Pesaran-Shin, and Breitung tests are used to determine the stationarity of the `diff_ln_price` and `abs_diff_ln_price` variables across all dyads in the panel dataset.\n",
    "- These tests help to assess whether the differences in prices between pairs of markets are stationary or non-stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Individual Augmented Dickey-Fuller Tests:\n",
    "- The `dfuller` test is applied to each `id_pair` for both `diff_ln_price` and `abs_diff_ln_price`.\n",
    "- This helps to understand the stationarity of the price differences within each pair of markets individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but why do we care?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stationary Series: A stationary time series has a constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation over time. This property is important for many time series models and econometric analyses, as it ensures that statistical inferences are valid.\n",
    "- Non-Stationary Series: A non-stationary series can lead to spurious regression results, where relationships between variables appear significant when they are not. Identifying and transforming non-stationary series into stationary ones (e.g., by differencing) is crucial for reliable analysis.\n"

    "The “control” group consists of all market pairs whose direct trading route using primary roads would not involve crossing the Zambezi at the new bridge.\n",
    "- Why do we see smaller numbers for distance variables in the control group compared to the treatment group?\n",
    "Because market pairs in the control group are more proximate compared to the treated pairs . Consequently,  the distributions of inter-market distances of the treatment and control groups do not fully overlap, implying not all market pairs will be equally informative regarding the impact of the opening of the bridge.\n"

    "- What do the round data points represent? The round data points represent the monthly mean price of white maize for twenty-five markets over the period 2005:01–2012:06, the price is deflated by CPI, setting the base year as 2005.\n",
    "- What is the red line? What does it measure? The red line is the lowess trend (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing). The authors mention that the changes of mean price linked to seasonal dynamics, including periods of drought (e.g., 2005/06; 2008/2009), as well as the increase in global commodity prices in the late 2000s. The lowess trend can help to remove their impact to find a more real trend of the maize price.\n",
    "- What is the vertical line? The dashed vertical line indicates the opening of the Zambezi bridge.\n",
    "- Do you see any changes in data before and after the vertical line? After the opening of the Zambezi bridge, the mean price changes within years is smaller and more stable compared with the previous years. Moreover, there is a small downward trending after the vertical line.\n",

    "- What are the two lines? What do the x data points represent on the blue line?  The black line is the mean absolute differences in log. real prices across market pairs over the full period by using the raw data. The blue line is the pre-whitened mean absolute differences in log. real prices. Authors utilize the pre-whitening to move unwanted noise from the series and eliminate common factors that may contaminate unit root tests. X data points represent pre-whitened mean absolute differences in log. real prices for different months.\n",
    "- What is the vertical line? The vertical line indicates the date of the opening of the Zambezi bridge.\n",
    "- What is the horizontal line? The horizontal line tells us that the pre-whitened price difference varies between around 0.2 and 0.3. This provides a preliminary indication that price differentials are likely to be stationary.\n",
    "- Do you see any changes in data before and after the vertical line? What is happening there? I don’t see large changes in data after the vertical line. But it seems that the price difference within a year and within different years is smaller.\n"

    "In this context, stationarity refers to whether the market price differentials between market dyads exhibit stable long-run equilibrium. The authors are testing whether the time series of absolute log price differentials between dyads contains unit roots before the opening of the bridge. A unit root process in this case would indicate non-stationarity in dyad price differentials, meaning that the long-run relationship between prices in the two markets is not stable and therefore the two markets are not integrated. In this case, the authors strongly reject the null hypothesis that the panels contain unit roots, supporting the alternative hypothesis that the differentials are a stationary process. ✍️ <span style=\"color:red\">This doesn't quite explain what stationarity is in this particular context.

    "The Hadri test has stationarity as the null hypothesis, the Harris-Tzavalis tests for a unit root, and focuses on panels with a small T; by assuming there are panels with a small number of time periods, but a large number of cross-sectional units. The Breitung test is suitable for large N and T; it focuses on common components of the panel data. The IPS test allows for heterogeneity in the autoregressive coefficients under the alternative hypothesis, affording flexibility in the panel structure. Finally the Pesaran test deals with the spatial dependence across panels by adding cross-sectional averages to a panel specific Augmented Dickey Fuller test. The motivation for including all of these different tests is a) these tests make different assumptions, and have different applications so consistency between them will make the resulting conclusions more statistically robust. \n",
