# Problem 1

## Problem 1(a)

```{r prob1a}
#code for prob1a
```

\hstart

Plot A  exhibits the most 'within group' variation out of all three plots and, will result in a large $SS_{error}$ because the individual observations vary most significantly from the mean. $MS_{error}$ is calculated as $SS_{error}/DF_{error}$ so because plot A has the largest $SS_{error}$, it will have the largest $MS_{error}$. 

\hstop

## Problem 1(b)

```{r prob1b}
#code for prob1b

```


\hstart

Plot C exhibits the most 'between group' variation of the three plots, and will result in a large $SS_{treatment}$ because the sample means for each group differ the most from the overall mean across all groups. $MS_{treatment}$ is equal to $SS_{treatment}/DF_{treatment}$; because plot C has the largest $SS_{treatment}$ of the three, it will have the largest $MS_{treatment}$. 

\hstop

## Problem 1(c)

```{r prob1c}
#code for prob1a

```

\hstart

The plot that will have the largest F-statistic is plot C. The formula for the $F_{test}$ is $F_{test} = MS_{treatment}/MS_{error}$. Plot C has the largest $MS_{error}$, plot B has small values for $MS_{error}$ and $MS_{treatment}$, and plot A has small $MS_{treatment}$, but large $MS_{error}$. Based on the formula for the F statistic, plot C will have the largest $F_{test}$

\hstop

## Problem 1(d)

```{r prob1d}
#code for prob1d

```

\hstart

The experiment that resulted in the largest p-value will be plot B. For these ANOVA plots, the null hypothesis $H_0$ states that $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu$, the population means are equal to each other. Looking at these three plots, the means for the three groups in plot B are very close together and there is very little between group variation. The p-value will be large for this group because out of all the plots, in plot B we have the lowest confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$ saying that these groups are equal based on the small $MS_{treatment}$, how close these means are to each other. 

\hstop

# Problem 2

```{r prob2}
#code for prob2
#data$factor = as.factor(data$treatment)
```

\hstart

This researcher does not see the group means because he did not convert treatment to a factor. R is treating treatment as a numeric variable instead of a factor and there is a slope coefficient for treatment 'trt' in the R output as a result. In order to fix this issue, the researcher should convert treatment to a factor, as is done in the code below: (also written in the appendix)
data(dollarsign)factor = as.factor(data$treatment)

# Problem 3

## Problem 3(a)

```{r prob3a}
#code for prob3a

##Setup items:
#load dataset
oxygendata <- read_csv("oxygen.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
attach(oxygendata)
#convert distance into a factor, right now it is a number
oxygendata$distance = as.factor(oxygendata$distance)

##3a code
ggplot(oxygendata, aes(x=distance, y=oxygen)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = distance), outlier.colour = NA, position = "dodge") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = .10)) +ylab("Dissolved Oxygen (Mg/L)") +
  ggtitle("Oxygen Data Scatter and Box Plot") +
  scale_x_discrete(name="Treatment",breaks=c("1","2","3","4"),
                  labels=c("Closest","Next Closest","Next Furthest","Furthest")) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 10) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

\hstart

## Problem 3(b)

\hstop

```{r prob3b}
#code for prob3b
oxygen_summary2 <- oxygendata %>%
  group_by(distance) %>%
  summarize("n" = length(oxygen), 
            "sample_mean" = mean(oxygen), 
            "sample_sd" = sd(oxygen),
            "se" = sample_sd/sqrt(n))
kable(oxygen_summary2)
```

\hstart

## Problem 3(c)

\hstop

```{r prob3c}
#code for prob3c
lm_oxygen <- lm(oxygen ~ distance, data = oxygendata)
anova(lm_oxygen)
```

\hstart

## Problem 3(d)

\hstop

```{r prob3d}
#code for prob3d

```

\hstart

The decision for the F-test based on this ANOVA table output will be to reject the null hypothesis that $\mu_1 =\mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_k$. The F-statistic measures the ratio of the variability of between group means in this case $MS_{distance}$ to that of within group variability $MS_{error}$ for each sample. Larger f values mean that the between group variability is larger than that within groups. From this we conclude that not all of the population group means are equal. In terms of this experiment, this means that the dissolved oxygen content will vary depending on the distance from the mouth of the Mississippi River.

# Problem 4

## Problem 4(a)

```{r prob4a}
#code for prob4a
```

\hstart

$\bar{Y_1\cdot} = 50.3$
$\bar{Y_2\cdot} = 50.3 + 10.8 = 61.1$
$\bar{Y_3\cdot} = 50.3 - 12.0 = 38.3$

\hstop

```{r prob4b}
#code for prob4b

```

## Problem 4(b)

\hstart

$\bar{Y_1\cdot} = 50.3$
$\bar{Y_2\cdot} = 61.1$
$\bar{Y_3\cdot} = 38.3$

$\bar{Y}\cdot\cdot = (\Sigma_{i=1}^k\Sigma_{j=1}^n Y_{ij})/nk$
$\bar{Y}\cdot\cdot = (\bar{Y_1\cdot} + \bar{Y_2\cdot} + \bar{Y_3\cdot})/3$
$\bar{Y}\cdot\cdot = 49.9$

$SS_{treatment} = n\Sigma_{i=1}^k (\bar{Y}\cdot -\bar{Y}\cdot\cdot)^2 = 3121.92$

# Problem 5

```{r prob5}
#code for prob5
```

\hstart

Calculating the values in the ANOVA table (with steps)

A.
$df_{treatmnet} = df_{total} -df_{error}$
$df_{treatment} = 4$

B.
$SS_{total} = SS_{error} + SS_{treatment}$
$1174.24 = 186.52 + SS_{treatment}$
$SS_{treatment} = 1174.24 - 186.52$
$SS_{treatment} = 987.71$

C. 
$MS_{error} = SS_{error}/df_{error}$
$MS_{error} = 186.53/25$
$MS_{error} = 7.4612$

D. 
$F_{stat} = MS_{treatment} / MS_{error}$
$F_{stat} = 33.095$
